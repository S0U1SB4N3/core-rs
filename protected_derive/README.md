# protected\_derive

A custom derive macro used to build Protected models in the Turtl core-rs
project. Protected models are the basis of safe data storage, handling
encryption and decryption of data in a safe and consistent manner.

This library's goal is to remove a large amount of boilerplate from the creation
of Protected models so instead of focusing on getting the details right every
time, we can focus on the model's specific functionality instead.
